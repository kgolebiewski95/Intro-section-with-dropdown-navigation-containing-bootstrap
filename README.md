- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover/click states for all interactive elements on the page

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Bootstrap
- Javascript*

### Continued development

In this project I tried to use Bootstrap for almost first time but encountered some minor problems halfway, mainly with navbar section. In the future I aim to choose more wisely when (and how) to use bootstrap. Not proud of expanding navigation at mobile-version.
